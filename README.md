This is a simple program to predict the house price of unit area of a piece of real estate.
The market historical data was collected from Xindian Dist. New Taipei City in Taiwan.
The data set is available for download at the following link:

DISCLAIMER: The resultant values in the data are in Ping in which 10 000 New Taiwan Dollars = 1 ping
For clarity I have converted the results into USD based on the conversion rate of
1 New Taiwan Dollar -> 0.032 USD of the user inputted values for prediction
There will also be some error in the prediction as the linear regression model alongside
the non-linear data in the data will lead to a semi good fit
